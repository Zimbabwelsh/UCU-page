**About UCU:**

The [University and College Union](https://www.ucu.org.uk) (UCU) represents over 130,000 academics, including managers, administrators, computer staff, librarians and postgraduates in universities, colleges, prisons, adult education and training organisations across the UK. UCU is affiliated with the Trade Unions Congress (TUC).

**What does UCU do?**

The union performs a couple of key functions, two in particular which are relevant to current disputes.

-	UCU negotiates with academic pay administrators on our behalf to secure our present.

-	UCU negotiates with pension schemes to secure our future.
