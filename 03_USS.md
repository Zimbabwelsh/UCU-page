The UCU is currently in a dispute with the USS over its recent valuation estimates for the pension scheme. 

The UCU balloted and ultimately undertook a period of [successful industrial action in 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018-2020_UK_higher_education_strikes). This functionally stopped the USS from changing the pension scheme from Defined Benefit (DB) to Defined Contribution (DC).

The USS has recently attempted again to push through pension payment changes which would negatively impact all members of the USS scheme, but particularly those who are early in their careers. UCU has [pushed back against this](https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/11437/UCU-response-to-USS-trustee-update), and Universities UK have also stated that they feel the increased contributions are unreasonable and likely to result in industrial action. 

The most recent valuation of the USS deficit was carried out in March 2020, whilst the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures' effect on markets were at their greatest. This resulted in a predictably low valuation, which the USS is using as justification for demanding increased payments from all members of the pension scheme.
