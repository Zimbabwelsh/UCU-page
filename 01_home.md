<strong>Welcome to the Bristol Population Health Sciences UCU Page<strong>

**About the PHS UCU**

We are the Population Health Sciences (PHS) UCU group. We come together occasionally (less so in recent times) to discuss what the UCU should do, and try to make sure that UCU members in PHS have somewhere they can make their voices heard. 

**Who are we?**

We are made up of employees within the Bristol PHS, we represent a range of workers including researchers, administrative staff, lecturers, IT services, postgraduate students and many more.

Bristol PHS is extremely fortunate to have many active and vocal union members who are approachable (virtually) and willing to chat about union membership with anyone interested. 

**Why is the union so important right now?** 

The COVID-19 pandemic has obviously changed the nature of working in academia and related industry, and left many of us isolated, working from home - and crucially unable to enjoy the benefits of our sociable and collegial office environment. As well as having obviously personal detrimental impacts, this also means that, as workers, we are more atomised and less able to reach out to other colleagues when things get tough. 

We have created this website as a central place for PHS employees to find out more about their local union, and provide information for those who might want to join but not know where to start!

**How can I find out more?**

There are a few things you can do if you want to find out more. The most obvious one, given that you're here already, is to read more on the website here. If you would like to speak to existing UCU members in PHS to get a feel for why they've joined and what it means, then feel free to get in contact with us.
