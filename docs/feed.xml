&lt;p&gt;This is a first attempt at making a website for the PHS UCU group. In the absence of physical solidarity, we can at least have something online to signpost interested folks to - and keep updated with the latest UCU goings on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been the product of a few hours spent by Gareth hacking away at Neil’s potentially dubious jekyll coding, so if you’re a member of the PHS UCU and are less bad at this than we are, and have suggestions how we could make this more engaging we’d be incredibly grateful for any suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out the code for this website &lt;a href=&quot;www.github.com/zimbabwelsh/UCU_page&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, we’d love suggestions, or if you’d like to fork the repo and make edits locally you can submit a pull request which we will very gratefully integrate!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Welcome" /><summary type="html">Welcome to the PHS UCU Webpage!</summary></entry></feed>
